- Record 'bell' sound in your own way. (should be in .aac format)
- Keep their names in english language as for statue recording 'statue.aac' and for bell recording 'bell.aac'


## Meditation/Game details (How it works internally)

- When Play button is clicked, it will play 'Statue' sound at any random time like 10, 20, 50 minutes later (any time in hour)
- Upon listening 'Statue', listener needs to become albsolutely statue for some seconds (after several seconds bell will be rang upon which normal working can be continued.)
